When I was a child, I had never written something by middle school. At least I remember nothing. I did not like to write something including that homework. I was not good a student.

But nowadays, I have to write every day in my first language. It's very important to write something like emails, blog posts, books in my professionals. I have translated or written some programming books in Korean

English is not my mother tongue. I have always hesitated to use English. But I must write on websites every day like github, stackoverflow, coursera. When someone ask me I feel exciting but very embarrassing. To explain in English my options to other people make me exhausted and scary. I am expecting this course give me a big support to get fluent for English writing.

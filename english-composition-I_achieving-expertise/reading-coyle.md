### Main argument/claim and evidence

* What is the writer’s main argument/claim?
  There is the sweat spot operating at the edges of your ability(14).
* What (if any) sub-claims/smaller claims does the writer make?
  Bjork said When you find that sweet spot, learning takes off(19).
  Deep practice.
* Evidence—what examples, research, and other evidence does the writer use?
Remembering many of word pairs(16).
Bjork's research(18)
Edwin Link's unusual device(20)
Brazil's futsal(24)

If we find out the sweet spot, we can boost up our learning.

We must find the sweat spot.

Coyle is arguing that deep practice is more important than just taking practices. To cultivate human ability must struggle to go through own mistakes as a German proverb, 'You will become clever through your mistakes'(11). To boost up learning we have to find out the sweet spot, operating at the edges of your ability(14). when you take practices in the sweat spot, you will struggle to go through trial and error. So, learning takes off(19).

He showed a remembering word game(16), Bjork's research(18), Edwin Link's unusual device(20), Brazil's futsal(24).
Learning under the sweat spot is taking odd practices. One of them is 'blank' for a remembering word game. And Shaquille O'Neal' did practice free throws from 14 feet and 16 feet, instead of the standard 15 feet in Bjork's research. Edwin Link invented a sweat spot device to teach flying. Brazilian players learn a soccer from futsal. All of them seem odd from standard and even good at entertaining:). Link sold his creatures to amusement parks and penny arcades(23).

A soccer zealot, Simon Clifford found out the sweat spot working on soccer. He studied why different is Brazilian soccer. He is arguing Brazilian players learn precise ball-handling techniques from futsal. It is better than normal soccer at learning ball-handling. They had taken deep practices through futsal. Honestly, I couldn't understand why does it work on. But, he made a wonderful proof by himself. Clifford had taught kids in his school. Four years later, his under-fourteen team defeated not only the Scottish national team of same age, but also Irish national team.



#### from Julie C Finkelstein

While he does say practice makes perfect ..he identifies key practice techniques
- slow done
- do it in chunks.
- find the sweet spot - where there is error
- practice with great deliberation and concentration
- (did he say visualization?)

He says deep practice is cool - there are two more factors:

- a great coach
- and great motivation which ignites the commitment to deep practice, ignition is how

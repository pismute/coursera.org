I always have a cup of coffee and food before writings. If I stressed out, I must feel more food cravings.

I love better noisy locations like cafes. Noisy locations is mandatory to write.

I am going to a cafe. I have a cup of cofees and some food before wiriting. Coffee help me to concentrate on writings. and food. If I got stressed out I feel food cravings. Noisy location is very important to me. While I write something I love to see people who pass through

I often spend an hour or half hour to clean computer file and folder and adjust editor configurations. I think It clean my aura.
